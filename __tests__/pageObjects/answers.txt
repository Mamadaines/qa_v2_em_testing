Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
No, these tests are not stabel and it is possible to get a false positive as you can see from the test that I added to find a particular position. 
Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
With these tests it would actually be better to search for them manually. If you did these tests through automation, you could miss bugs.
What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
Honestly I would like to learn how to make these tests better, I know they need to be more specific but this is not something that I currently know how to do or understand.
